## overview

## additional resources

### data to run examples in this repository

![test data link](./pics/data-link.png)

Data can be found as a zip archive (678 MB) at https://imbcloud.medizin.tu-dresden.de/sharing/pGlAPL3oQ Unzipping the file from within the main folder creates the default _test-data_ subfolder that is used in the notebook examples. If you choose another location for the data, the notebooks need to be adapted accordingly.

### image and tracking data
The image data (3D + time, 3 channels) for sample 1 is available for download at [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/search/?query=Name:idr0068).
Processed cell tracks to reproduce the plots in the notebooks is available at (link coming soon)

### Eidomatica
a custom Mathematica library for the analysis of tracking data
