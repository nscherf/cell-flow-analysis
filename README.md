## overview


## additional resources

### cell tracking data for testing
The image data (3D + time, 3 channels) for sample 1 is available for download at [IDR](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/search/?query=Name:idr0068).
Processed cell tracks to reproduce the plots in the notebooks is available at (link coming soon)

### Eidomatica
a custom Mathematica library for the analysis of tracking data
